# Mithun M Padmaja - My profile

Budding Data Scientist who completed Msc in Data Science and Analytics from the University of Leeds.

Truly interested and passionate in shaping data to make decisions for business improvements. There is hardly any field where science of Data Analysis has not made its presence felt. I have realised that the art of processing and understanding the humongous amount of data in a scientific way can help in effective decision making, leading to the implementation of more innovative ideas for successful outcomes. With opportunities in the domain of Data Analytics growing at a rapid rate, I wish to establish myself as a skilled Data Scientist in the industry and hence changed my career direction from the world of Testing/QA to the world of Data Science & Machine Learning.

Learned and have relevant experience in key data science concepts and techniques which includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Analysis, Machine Learning algorithms, Performance metrics, Python and R libraries, Big Data, ML end to end productisation etc..

Competent & diligent IT professional with an experience of 10 years in Software Testing in the Banking and Finance domain, professional experience from MNCs like Accenture, Fiserv and Suntec business solutions.

Effective team leader, trainer and motivator with excellent communication, negotiation, analytical & relationship-building skills to integrate team efforts to maximize team productivity.

Apart from technology, I love cricket, driving and traveling. Exploration in personal and professional life excites me which helped me to gain relevant life experiences.
